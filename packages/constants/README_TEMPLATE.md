# @jsonql/constants

This is a module export all the share constant use across all the
[jsonql](https://jsonql.org) modules.

Use it only when you want to develop your jsonql compatible module.
You can also use the included `constants.json`, if you are not using
Javascript to develop your module.

_As of 0.4.0, we no longer export the brower.js (it creates more problem then it solve)_

We split up the constants into sections:

- base
- prop
- socket
- validation

Please consult the detail break down below.
